# LeetCode&#8482; C++ Namespace

## About 📖

While getting ready for the technical interview, many programmers will consider <b>LeetCode</b> to test their knowledge with data structures and algorithms, as well as some coding tricks 💻.

One problem that faced was that <b>LeetCode</b> forces running and testing the code on the site not locally, also the input format for the test cases is as not as any other online judge (Codeforces / AtCoder), so it would be hard for one to test the code on local then modify it to fit on the format of <b>LeetCode</b> 🤕.

That's why I decided to create a namespace for <b>C++</b> that would take the input in the format of <b>LeetCode</b> and then return a standarized version of the input that you can use to test your solution 😎.

## Functions 📚

| Function Signature                                        | Description                                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `string parseInput(string &input)`                        | Parses the input string and returns a standardized version of it.                                    |
| `string readLine()`                                       | Reads a line from the input stream and returns it as a string.                                       |
| `string readToken()`                                      | Reads a token from the input stream and returns it as a string.                                      |
| `string readString()`                                     | Reads a string from the input stream and returns it as a string.                                     |
| `template <typename T> T readNumber()`                    | Reads a string from the input stream and returns it as a number of the given type.                   |
| `template <typename T> vector <T> toArray(string &input)` | Converts the input string to an array of the given type.                                             |
| `template <typename T> vector <T> readArray()`            | Reads an array from the input stream and returns it as a vector of the given type.                   |
| `template <typename T> vector<vector<T>> read2D()`        | Reads a two-dimensional array from the input stream and returns it as a 2D vector of the given type. |
| `template <typename T> ListNode<T> *readList()`           | Reads a linked-list of the given type from the input stream and returns a pointer to its head        |

## Usage Example 🚀

```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<leetcode.h>
using namespace std;
using namespace leet;

int main(){
    vector<int> arr = readArray<int>();
    vector<vector<string>> 2Darr = read2D<string>();
    float x = readNumber<float>();
    long double y = readNumber<long double>();
    string s = readString();
    return 0;
}
```

## Installation 🛠️

All you need is to copy `leetcode.h` to the include directory of your compiler, then you can include it in your code as shown in the example above.

example path for the include directory in the case of g++ on Windows :

```
C:\mysys64\ucrt64\include\c++\13.2.0
```

## Contribution 🤝

> [!NOTE]
> further information about the include directory can be found in the documentation of your compiler.\
> If you are using an online compiler, you can copy the content of the file and paste it at the beginning of your code.

> [!TIP]
> feel free to contribute to the project by adding more functions or improving the existing ones. 🚀
