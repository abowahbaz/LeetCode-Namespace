# LeetCode&#8482; C++ Namespace

## About

While getting ready for the technical interview, many programmers will consider <b>LeetCode</b> to test their knowledge with data structures and algorithms, as well as some coding tricks üíª.

One problem that faced me was that <b>LeetCode</b> forces running and testing the code on the site not the local, also the input format for the test cases is as not as any other online judge (Codeforces / AtCoder),so it would be hard for one to test the code on local then modify it to fit on the format of <b>LeetCode</b> ü§ï.

That's why I decided to create a namespace for <b>C++</b> that would take the input in the format of <b>LeetCode</b> then returns a standarized version of the input that you can use to test your solution üòé.

## Key Functions

| Function Signature                                            | Description                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `string parseInput(string &input)`                            | Parses the input string and returns a standardized version of it.                                    |
| `string readLine()`                                           | Reads a line from the input stream and returns it as a string.                                       |
| `string readToken()`                                          | Reads a token from the input stream and returns it as a string.                                      |
| `string readString()`                                         | Reads a string from the input stream and returns it as a string.                                     |
| `template < typename T > T readNumber()`                      | Reads a string from the input stream and returns it as a number of the given type.                   |
| `template < typename T > vector < T > toArray(string &input)` | Converts the input string to an array of the given type.                                             |
| `template < typename T > vector < T > readArray()`            | Reads an array from the input stream and returns it as a vector of the given type.                   |
| `template < typename T > vector < vector < T >> read2D()`     | Reads a two-dimensional array from the input stream and returns it as a 2D vector of the given type. |
| `template <typename T> ListNode<T> *readList()`               | Reads a linked-list of the given type from the input stream and returns a pointer to its head        |

## Usage Example

```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<leetcode.h>
using namespace std;
using namespace leet;

int main(){
    vector<int> arr = readArray<int>(str);
    vector<vector<string>> 2Darr = read2D<string>(str);
    float x = readNumber<float>();
    long double y = readNumber<long double>();
    string s = readString();
    return 0;
}
```

## Installation

All you need is to copy <code>leetcode.h</code> to the include directory of your compiler, then you can include it in your code as shown in the example above.

example path for the include directory in the case of g++ on windows :

```
C:\mysys64\ucrt64\include
```

> [!NOTE]
> further information about the include directory can be found in the documentation of your compiler.\
> If you are using an online compiler, you can copy the content of the file and paste it at the beginning of your code.

> [!TIP]
> feel free to contribute to the project by adding more functions or improving the existing ones. üöÄ
