# LeetCode&#8482; C++ Namespace

# About
While getting ready to the technical interview, many programmers will consider <b>LeetCode</b> to test their knowledge with data structures and algorithms, as well as some coding tricks ðŸ’». 

One problem that faced me was that <b>LeetCode</b> forces running and testing the code on the site not the local, also the input format for the test cases is as not as any other online judge (Codeforces / AtCoder),so it would be hard for one to test the code on local then modify it to fit on the format of <b>LeetCode</b> ðŸ¤•.

That's why I decided to create a namespace for <b>C++</b> that would take the input in the format of <b>LeetCode</b> then returns a standarized version of the input that you can use to test you solution ðŸ˜Ž
